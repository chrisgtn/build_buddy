ðŸ“„ Makefile

Old-school Unix-style build automation
What it does:
-It defines rules like:
-How to compile .c files into .o object files (compiled binaries, but not yet executable).
-How to link .o files into the final program (an executable).
-It has a clean rule to delete build artifacts (start fresh).

Commands explained:
make â†’ run default build rule (produces build/main)
make clean â†’ deletes build/ and .o files to clean the workspace.
ðŸ“„ SConstruct

Python-based build file for SCons
What it does:
Defines a build process in Python rather than Makefile syntax.
Very simple: it just says "compile src/main.c and src/math_utils.c into build/main."
âœ… SCons automatically handles dependencies more intelligently than Make.
ðŸ“„ buildbuddy.py

Python CLI tool built with Typer
What it does:
Provides a nice command-line interface with commands like:
build --system=make â†’ run make
build --system=scons â†’ run scons
clean â†’ run make clean
Measures how long the build takes.
Gives nice terminal feedback when the build finishes.
âœ… This simulates internal developer tools that help engineers build code easily.
ðŸ”¥ Very Short Summary

Makefile and SConstruct automate building your tiny C project.
buildbuddy.py is your Python wrapper tool that gives devs a friendly way to use those build systems.
In a real DevEx role, you'd be the person writing or improving exactly this type of thing to make developers' lives easier.
